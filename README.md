MediaList
=========

MediaList is a simple C# movie and TV show listing application, specifically for collections spanning multiple drives or folders.

It does this by quickly scanning through user-defined sets of directories, indexing files and folders inside, and creating sorted, searchable lists of movies and TV shows.

It features real-time searching and the ability to open a selection in Windows Explorer.
